<h1>The Best Movies According To Rik</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Grave of The Fireflies</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite animes, it's about a post war situation of a brother and a sister having their parents killed in the war and them being neglected by the remaining of their family.</p>
<h3>Wall-e</h3>
<p>This is a cartoon movie. It is based on a futuristic approach of post apocalyptic earth where robots are the sole survivors who come visit earth and one of the female robots fall in love with a stranded male ugly robot who was living on his accord on earth. The movie is cute.</p>
<h4>Jumanji</h4>
<p>I really loved this movie back when I was a kid. Its about a board game where things actually come to life with the instructions passed on by the board.</p>
